# Action + Connection

#### _Javascript Team Week Project for Epicodus, 02.03.17_

#### By _**Michelle Llaguno, Ellie Angell, Ezra Sandzer-Bell, Frankie Gavin**_

## Description

This past election has left many people wanting to get more politically involved without a clear idea where to start. With our Action + Connection web app, we aim to give those people some direction. This admin focused site has three main objectives: to inform people on the latest issue facing the nation and who to contact about it; to list volunteer opportunities in the Portland area to help you get more involved politicially; to list social events and movements in the Portland area to help you connect with like-minded people. The administer can add issues and events themselves, but users can sign up to the site to add events as well. 

## Prerequisites

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
